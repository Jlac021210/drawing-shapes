Record at least one time when your program's behavior differed from what you wanted it to do.
It didnt turn enough resulting in the shape not being fully made

What are the differences between the actual and desired behavior?
the shape had gaps between the side lengths and the turns wernet sharp enough

What is your process for figuring out the problem with your code?
i looked at the code to see what changes the angle of the shape and remebered the angles need to add to 360

What is the solution to this bug? That is, what do you need to fix about your code to make it have the desired behavior?
i divided 360/3 to give 120 and turned by 120 instead and that fixed it

Record at least one time when your program didn't compile.
Shapes.java:57: error: cannot find symbol
What compilation errors did you get?
Cannot find symbol
What is your process for figuring out the problem with your code? Describe the resources or strategies you used in this process.
i check the line which has the error and i look to see were the variables are getting declared and i used that to fix this one
What is the solution to the bug? That is, what do you need to fix about your code to make it compile?
i named the variable wrong i named it counter when i declared it but when i called it was count
